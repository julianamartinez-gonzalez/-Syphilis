	<h3>What is our team's Disease? </h3>

	<p> Syphilis</p>

 <h3>What is our team's Prototype?</h3>
 <p>Our team decided that the way we should combat the problem of Syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease (Read more about it on the Background page),by creating an app whichs movtives is too help educate young sexually active people. Also the app helps encourge these people to go and get regular check ups and in parthership with the S-Chip and S-Kit we can give get insights to these people. We choose to do an app which connects to the chip because it is the most effective to give this information to young sexually active people. Since this app is simlair to another Social Media app popular to young people, hint hint Instagram, we hope these encourges them to use the app more frequently. </p>

<h2> 2. Your Profile </h2>
<p>On the S app you have your own profile. Once the data from the chip or the kit has been collected it will send that information to the app. On the app you will be able to see your status (Negative or Positive). You can set up your bio. You will need check ups from a real doctor every so often to makesure everything is up to date.</p>
